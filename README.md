# Hexa
Hexa is a bot with Discord's newest features like Activities and Youtube Together. We also feature some fun commands like `-ai` and `-tictactoe` as well as other utilities.

## a few important features we have:
- Youtube Together! A new feature that allows you and your friends to watch and queue up Youtube videos in a voice channel. Just run `/youtube` and type in the voice channel you want to watch in and let Hexa do the rest!
- Discord Snowflake lookup: Forgot when you made your account? Use `-snowflake` with your account id (ex. `524722785302609941`) to find out.
- Global server ranking, see how active your server is compared to others

## what are discord activities?
Discord activites are a new in-development voice channel feature that allows you and your friends to enjoy games and videos together in a voice channel. 

It's a breeze to start an activity. Just use `/activity` and provide the voice channel, as well as the activity you wish to start.

### at this time we support the following activities:
~~~
- Youtube Together
- Fishington.io
- Poker Night
- Betrayal.io
- Chess in the Park (still in early development)
~~~

We will continue to add more as Discord rolls them out.
